- ‚öôÔ∏è Highly configurable with enterprise-grade flexibility
- üì® Rich message types for transparent voting processes
- üîÑ Robust state management with audit trails
- üéØ Real-world examples for immediate implementation

**Use Cases:**
- Code review approval workflows
- Architecture decision processes
- Content moderation systems
- Feature prioritization meetings
- Any scenario requiring group consensus

For detailed usage instructions, see the [README.md](README.md) and check out the examples in the `/examples` directory.
