## 🎯 Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_agentchat.conditions import MaxMessageTermination

from autogen_voting import VotingGroupChat, VotingMethod

async def main():
    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model="gpt-4o")
    
    # Create voting agents
    agents = [
        AssistantAgent("Alice", model_client, system_message="Expert in backend systems"),
        AssistantAgent("Bob", model_client, system_message="Frontend specialist"), 
        AssistantAgent("Carol", model_client, system_message="Security expert")
    ]
    
    # Create voting team
    voting_team = VotingGroupChat(
        participants=agents,
        voting_method=VotingMethod.MAJORITY,
        require_reasoning=True,
        max_discussion_rounds=2,
        termination_condition=MaxMessageTermination(20)
    )
    
    # Run voting process
    result = await voting_team.run(task="""
        Proposal: Should we migrate our API from REST to GraphQL?
        
        Please vote APPROVE or REJECT with detailed reasoning.
    """)
    
    print(f"Decision: {result}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 📋 Use Cases

### 1. Code Review Voting 👨‍💻

Perfect for collaborative code reviews with multiple reviewers:

```python
# Qualified majority voting for code reviews
voting_team = VotingGroupChat(
    participants=[senior_dev, security_expert, performance_engineer],
    voting_method=VotingMethod.QUALIFIED_MAJORITY,
    qualified_majority_threshold=0.67,  # Require 2/3 approval
    require_reasoning=True
)

task = """
Proposal: Approve merge of PR #1234 - "Add Redis caching layer"

Code changes implement memory caching to reduce database load.
Please review for: security, performance, maintainability.

Vote APPROVE or REJECT with detailed reasoning.
"""
```

### 2. Architecture Decisions 🏗️

Use ranked choice voting for complex architectural decisions:

```python
# Ranked choice for architecture decisions
voting_team = VotingGroupChat(
    participants=[tech_lead, architect, devops_engineer],
    voting_method=VotingMethod.RANKED_CHOICE,
    max_discussion_rounds=3
)

task = """
Proposal: Choose microservices communication pattern

Options:
1. REST APIs with Service Mesh
2. Event-Driven with Message Queues  
3. GraphQL Federation
4. gRPC with Load Balancing

Provide ranked preferences with reasoning.
"""
```

### 3. Content Moderation 🛡️

Majority voting for content approval/rejection:

```python
# Simple majority for content moderation
voting_team = VotingGroupChat(
    participants=[community_manager, safety_specialist, legal_advisor],
    voting_method=VotingMethod.MAJORITY,
    allow_abstentions=True,
    max_discussion_rounds=1
)
```

### 4. Feature Prioritization 📈

Unanimous consensus for high-stakes decisions:

```python
# Unanimous voting for feature prioritization
voting_team = VotingGroupChat(
    participants=[product_manager, engineering_lead, ux_designer],
    voting_method=VotingMethod.UNANIMOUS,
    max_discussion_rounds=4
)
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Voting Methods

```python
from autogen_voting import VotingMethod

VotingMethod.MAJORITY           # >50% approval
VotingMethod.PLURALITY          # Most votes wins
VotingMethod.UNANIMOUS          # All voters must agree
VotingMethod.QUALIFIED_MAJORITY # Configurable threshold
VotingMethod.RANKED_CHOICE      # Ranked preferences
```

### Advanced Settings

```python
VotingGroupChat(
    participants=agents,
    voting_method=VotingMethod.QUALIFIED_MAJORITY,
    qualified_majority_threshold=0.75,    # 75% threshold
    allow_abstentions=True,               # Allow abstaining
    require_reasoning=True,               # Require vote reasoning
    max_discussion_rounds=3,              # Discussion before re-vote
    auto_propose_speaker="lead_agent",    # Auto-select proposer
    max_turns=25,                         # Turn limit
    emit_team_events=True                 # Enable event streaming
)
```

## 🔄 Voting Process Flow

```
1. PROPOSAL PHASE
   ├─ Agent presents structured proposal
   ├─ ProposalMessage with options and details
   └─ Transition to voting phase

2. VOTING PHASE  
   ├─ All eligible voters cast VoteMessage
   ├─ Reasoning and confidence tracking
   ├─ Real-time vote collection
   └─ Check for completion/consensus

3. DISCUSSION PHASE (if no consensus)
   ├─ Open discussion among participants
   ├─ Limited rounds (configurable)
   ├─ Address concerns and questions
   └─ Return to voting phase

4. CONSENSUS PHASE
   ├─ VotingResultMessage with summary
   ├─ Final decision and rationale
   └─ Process completion
```

## 📊 Message Types

The extension provides structured message types for transparent voting:

- **`ProposalMessage`** - Structured proposals with options and metadata
- **`VoteMessage`** - Votes with reasoning, confidence scores, and ranked choices  
- **`VotingResultMessage`** - Comprehensive results with participation analytics

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Agent Design
- Give agents distinct expertise and perspectives
- Include clear voting instructions in system messages
- Design agents to provide reasoning for transparency

### Proposal Structure  
- Be specific about what's being decided
- Provide relevant context and constraints
- Include clear voting options when applicable

### Voting Configuration
- Choose appropriate voting method for decision type
- Set reasonable discussion rounds (2-4 typical)
- Consider requiring reasoning for important decisions
