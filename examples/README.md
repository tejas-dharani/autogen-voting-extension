### **Scenario Design Guidelines**
```python
# Example: Well-structured research scenario
scenario = BenchmarkScenario(
    name="security_code_review_qualified_majority",
    scenario_type=ScenarioType.CODE_REVIEW,
    description="Security-critical code review requiring expert consensus",
    task_prompt="""[Detailed, contextualized proposal with clear stakes]""",
    agent_personas=[
        {"name": "SecurityExpert", "role": "CISO", "description": "Enterprise security architecture focus"},
        {"name": "LeadDeveloper", "role": "Principal Engineer", "description": "Production system reliability focus"},
        {"name": "ComplianceOfficer", "role": "Risk Manager", "description": "Regulatory compliance focus"}
    ],
    complexity_level="high",        # Controls deliberation depth
    stakes_level="critical",        # Influences voting thresholds
    time_pressure="normal"          # Affects consensus urgency
)
```
